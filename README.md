      Ternary Operator..
      condition ? exp1 : exp2
      (marks > 30 ) ? 'pass' : 'fail'
      

FOR LOOPS.....
for Lop :- Loop a block of code no of times.
FOR(LET I = 0; I < 10 ; I++) {
     CONSOLE.LOG(i)
}

FOR-IN-LOOP:- LOOPS THROUGH THE KEYS OF AN OBJECT
let obj = {
pintu: 90,
akash: 45,
mantu:57,
shiv: 44
}
for(let a in obj){
console.log("MArks of " + a + " are " + obj[a])
}

FOR- OF-LOOP:- LOOPS THROUGH THE VALUES OF AN OBJECTS.
for(let b of "akash") {
console.log(b)
}

WHILE LOOP:- LOOPS A BLOCK BASED ON A SPECIFIC CONDITION
let n = prompt("Enter The Value of n")
n = Number.parseInt(n)
let i = 0;
while(i < n) {
console.log(i)
i++;
}

DO WHILE LOOP:- WHILE LOOP VARIENT WHICH RUNS AtLEAST ONCE.
do {
console.log(i)
i++;
} while (i < n)



Functions................
A javascript Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

function myFunction () {
// Code
}

function Binod func (parameter 1, parameter 2) {
// code
}
Binod func(7,8)



const hello = () => {
console.log("Hey how are you. ")
}
hello()


arrow Function........
const sum = (a, b) => {
return a + b
}
console.log(sum(9, 7))


..................STRING.................
template Literls :- use backtics insted of quotes to define a String

Let boy1 = "Pramod"
let boy2 = "Nikhil"
Let sentence = `boy1 is a friend of boy2`

let fruit = 'Bana\'na'   
console fruit // 
\l = new Line
\t = tab
\r = carriage Return.


.....Array.......

changing the value = 
let numbers = [7 , 2 , 49 ,9]
number[2] = 8 //[7,2 , 8, 9]


...... Map. Filter . Reduce.......

mao() :- create a new Array by performing some operation on each array element.
const a = [1, 2, 3]
a.map((value, index, array) => {
return value * value;
})

filter() ;-  filters ana array with values that passes a test creates a new array
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4. 5]
a.filter(greater_than_5)
